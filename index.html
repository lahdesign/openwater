                <h2>What Is Water Pollution?</h2>
                <p id="pollution">Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or
                    microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading
                    water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment.</p>

                <h2 id="causes">What Are the Causes of Water Pollution?</h2>
                <p id="causesp">Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal solvent,” water is able
                    to
                    dissolve more substances than any other liquid on earth. It’s the reason we have Kool-Aid and
                    brilliant
                    blue waterfalls. It’s also why water is so easily polluted. Toxic substances from farms, towns, and
                    factories readily dissolve into and mix with it, causing water pollution.</p>

                <h2 id="groundwater">Groundwater</h2>
                <p id="groundwaterp">When rain falls and seeps deep into the earth, filling the cracks, crevices, and
                    porous
                    spaces of an aquifer (basically an underground storehouse of water), it becomes groundwater—one of
                    our
                    least visible but most important natural resources. Nearly 40 percent of Americans rely on
                    groundwater,
                    pumped to the earth’s surface, for drinking water. For some folks in rural areas, it’s their only
                    freshwater source. Groundwater gets polluted when contaminants—from pesticides and fertilizers to
                    waste
                    leached from landfills and septic systems—make their way into an aquifer, rendering it unsafe for
                    human
                    use. Ridding groundwater of contaminants can be difficult to impossible, as well as costly. Once
                    polluted, an aquifer may be unusable for decades, or even thousands of years. Groundwater can also
                    spread contamination far from the original polluting source as it seeps into streams, lakes, and
                    oceans.

                <h2 id="surface">Surface water</h2>
                <p id="surfacep">Covering about 70 percent of the earth, surface water is what fills our oceans, lakes,
                    rivers, and all those other blue bits on the world map. Surface water from freshwater sources (that
                    is,
                    from sources other than the ocean) accounts for more than 60 percent of the water delivered to
                    American
                    homes. But a significant pool of that water is in peril. According to the most recent surveys on
                    national water quality from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, nearly half of our rivers and
                    streams and more than one-third of our lakes are polluted and unfit for swimming, fishing, and
                    drinking.
                    Nutrient pollution, which includes nitrates and phosphates, is the leading type of contamination in
                    these freshwater sources. While plants and animals need these nutrients to grow, they have become a
                    major pollutant due to farm waste and fertilizer runoff. Municipal and industrial waste discharges
                    contribute their fair share of toxins as well. There’s also all the random junk that industry and
                    individuals dump directly into waterways.</p>

                <h2 id="ocean">Ocean water</h2>
                <p id="oceanp">Eighty percent of ocean pollution (also called marine pollution) originates on
                    land—whether
                    along the coast or far inland. Contaminants such as chemicals, nutrients, and heavy metals are
                    carried
                    from farms, factories, and cities by streams and rivers into our bays and estuaries; from there they
                    travel out to sea. Meanwhile, marine debris—particularly plastic—is blown in by the wind or washed
                    in
                    via storm drains and sewers. Our seas are also sometimes spoiled by oil spills and leaks—big and
                    small—and are consistently soaking up carbon pollution from the air. The ocean absorbs as much as a
                    quarter of man-made carbon emissions.</p>

            <h1 id="voice">WITH YOUR VOICE</h1>
            <p id="voicep">One of the most effective ways to stand up for our waters is to speak out in support of the Clean Water
                Rule, which clarifies the Clean Water Act’s scope and protects the drinking water of one in three
                Americans.

                Tell the federal government, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and your local elected officials that you
                support the Clean Water Rule. Also, learn how you and those around you can get involved in the
                policymaking process. Our public waterways serve every American. We should all have a say in how they’re
                protected.</p>
